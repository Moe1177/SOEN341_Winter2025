# SOEN 341 Title

## Description

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column;">
<div>A versatile communication platform allows real-time communication and community building through text channels and direct messaging.<br></div>
<br>
<div>This web application allows users to communicate together whether personally to contact another user or whether to join a community of<br> users to discuss different subjects as a group. We answer the need of connectivity between users such as students, friends, communities, <br>QA, and so on. It also permits us to enhance the user experience with intuitive design which is clean easy to navigate and free of complexity.<br></div>
<br>
<div>Users have the ability to either directly message other users, join existing channels to asociate with or create their own channels <br>for their own reasons. The platform also seperates users based on roles (Role-Based Permisions), giving admins the capability to manage <br>channels and messages with the capacity to create or detele channels and supervise messages and giving members only the capability to send <br> or view messages.</div>
<br>
<div>The communication platform is for everyone from friends and familty to peers in school and coworkers. It can be used by anyone,<br> anytime and anywhere!</div>
<br>
<div>Once users have an account, they can either join a group or start a group depending on their user-based role. Once a one-on-one chat or a<br> server is created users, whether members or admins, can view and send messages.<div> 
<ol><li>The <b>General channels</b> are where users can communicate or ask general questions.</li><li>The <b>Project Help channels</b> assist people that are working on projects, helping them with tasks related to the given server.</li><li>The <b>Social channels</b> are where users build the community allowing them to engage in fun conversations and connect on a more personal level.</li></ol>

## Objective

<!-- Objectif is for the class or the app?-->

Develop a flexible, easy to use, versatile and friendly communication platform using the proper tools such as React.js, Java Spring<br>
Boot and MongoDB. This will allow us to learn the basics and understand the fundamental technologies behind a web app such as the frontend and backend development and it will also allow us to practice using the agile methodologies.

## Core features of the project

The following core features will be available in this project:

- ### Text Channels For Group Communication
  - Ability to join group chats and visibility of messages to all group members.
- ### Direct Messsaging Between Users
